Alexander2017 summary: 
This article is about how the Healthy Brain Network collects data for studying mental health disorders in adolescents. It explains everything (in excruciating detail) from their recruitment process where they find patients in NYC through various community outreach programs, to the assessments they use on each subject. It has several tables that show the types of assessments, data quality metrics etc. And The data they gather includes MRI scans, voice recordings, EEG, genetic samples, and behavioral tests. Their main focus is basically to building a large and diverse dataset to help researchers find biomarkers for different conditions. So, do something called transdiagnostic research and find homogeneity in each category of the disorder, to learn about variations that could be present in each disorder itself. There’s also a lot about data quality checks, handling motion issues in MRI, and adjusting protocols over time which is extremely boring. It’s more about the process of data collection than actual findings, but it really shows how detailed their approach is.
